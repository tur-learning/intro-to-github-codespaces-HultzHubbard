If statements needed to make decisions in code (conditionals)
    if it's sunny, wear sunglasses
Executes a block of code only when specific condition is met, otherwise skip to next condition

Syntax:
if condition:
    # code that runs if
    # the condition is true
    pass

True or false expression

Bullian = true/false code

Comparison operators:
>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
Can be used to compare values

else statements:
an alternative to the conditions (if all the "if statements" are false, then the "else" statement is run)

elif statements:
to have multiple conditions (only when all if/elif functions are false else is run; if -> elif -> elif ect. in order top to bottom)

if statements stops checking conditions after the first true condition

Logical operators:
and - both conditions have to be true
or - at least one condition needs to be true
not - negates the condition

Nested If statements
an if statement within an if statement
Max number is 3 (otherwise gets too hard to follow code)
