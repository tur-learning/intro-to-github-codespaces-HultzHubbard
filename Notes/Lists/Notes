# Collecting ordered items (collection of items)
# Created with []
    # e.g. numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

# they are mutable (can change, add, or remove elements without creating a new list)
    # numbers[3] = 0
    # numbers = numbers + ['hi']
    # numbers.remove(300)

# list methods:
# - append(x): add x to the end of the list
# - insert(index, x): insert x at a specific index
# - remove(x): remove first occurance of x
# - pop(index): remove and return the item at index (default is the last item)
# - sort(): sort the list in place
# - count(x): counts number of items in the list
# - reverse(): reverse order of items in list

# iterations print every item individually:
# for n in list
    # print(n)
