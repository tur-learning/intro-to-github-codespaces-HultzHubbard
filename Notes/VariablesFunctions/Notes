Function, a named sequence of statements that preform a task
- each input (domain) has one output (range)
- makes a complex problem simpler, eliminate repetative code, and name a group of statements

Defining Functions
- start with "def" keyword and ends with colon (body needs to be indented)

Types of Functions
    print() - string litteral, text enclosed in quotes
    type() - tells type of command

Variables, refers to a value (never begin with numbers, only letters and numbers)
Value, number or word

Expression, combination of variables, values, and operators
Statements, units of code with an effect (e.g. assigning a variable)
    interpreter executes Statements

Python follows PEMDAS

# comments - explains code in natural language

Recursion
- dont always need to read code top to bottom, but function needs to be deffined before function is run

When a variable is created inside a function, it is local and doesn't exist outside function

void funciton, preforms an action but doesn't return a value
