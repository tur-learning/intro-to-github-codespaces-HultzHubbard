# main.py - We'll start by printing
# the classic "Hello, World!" message.
 
print("Hello, World!")  # inline comment.
 
# Storing a name (string) into a variable
# and concatenate it to the string "Hello, "
# to use in a print statements.
 
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name + "!") # <--- Here!
 
# Assign two integer variables and
# print their sum directly.
 
num1 = 5  # First integer variable
num2 = 7  # Second integer variable
print("Their sum is:", num1 + num2)
 
# Assign the sum to a third integer
# variable and then print it.
 
total = num1 + num2  # Storing their sum.
print("The sum (stored) is:", total)
 
# This script is made of 24 lines + an
